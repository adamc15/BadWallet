# Welcome to Bad Wallet! 

Our mission is to provide a place for people to report known bad wallets, exchanges, socials, projects, etc... with the intent of publishing and sharing this information on a large scale so we can save people from falling victim to these same scammers. The eventual goal would be to provide an API to our database so that wallet builders, exchanges, and other organizations could actively warn and block users from sending to these known bad wallets. <br/>

## Can you get me my money back?

Unfortunately, most likely we're not getting any of your money back. The goal of this tool is to collect and publish information about KNOWN Bad (wallets, socials, exchanges, projects, etc...) and share this on a wide enough scale to stop these scams from happening to other people, and hopefully stop those scammers from spending the stolen funds. 

## What kinds of scams do you have information on?

Originally I had the idea of a sort of "wallet blacklist" where wallets deemed "bad" were collected and indexed for searching. However, I realized there's more than just "bad wallets" out there and could see this tool collecting many more types of "Known Bads" including downloads, exchanges, projects, etc...<br/>

## Who the hell are you?

Me? I'm no one, seriously. Just a guy who got into crypto / blockchain back in 2017. I had this idea randomly, sat on it for four years and am now putting it together to hopefully help grow adoption. Many people STILL don't know what blockchain technology or cryptocurrency really is or does. We need to be ready to help them get in safely when they join us. <br/>

## What's your end game / goal?

Honestly, I'd love to help grow and build trust for people using digital currency and other blockchain based projects. I would love to show people there are centralized resources people can use to help keep themselves safe. My promise is this, I will NEVER charge people coming to run a check for themselves of a wallet address or ever if people want to read about new or ongoing scams. However, I will eventually have to implement some form of charge for larger groups, organizations or applications that want to do multiple or frequent lookups to our database, or even API to our data since it will eventually grow in size and by that point liekly cost more money to run.  <br/>
